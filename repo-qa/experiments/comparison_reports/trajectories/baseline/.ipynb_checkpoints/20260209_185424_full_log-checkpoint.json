  "final_answer": "I explored the minisweagent package root to find likely entry points and config handling code. The repository contains several CLI mains under run/, and a DefaultAgent implementation under agents/default.py. The grep output shows multiple main() functions (run/mini.py, run/hello_world.py, run/inspector.py, run/extra/*.py) which are the probable command-line entry points that parse argv and accept a config path. The configuration-related logic (resolving paths, loading YAML, building Config objects) is located in the config package (the folder config/ in this package). The class DefaultAgent is defined at agents/default.py:65 and is the consumer of the constructed Config. To complete each investigation aspect precisely, the next steps would be to open:\n\n- run/mini.py (and/or the specific run/* main used by the CLI / __main__.py) to see how argv is parsed and which argument specifies the YAML config file (ASPECT 1).\n- files in the config/ package to find functions like resolve_config_path, load_yaml, and Config.from_dict to see how paths are normalized/expanded, how YAML bytes are read, and how mappings are converted to Config objects (ASPECTs 2–4).\n- agents/default.py (DefaultAgent.__init__) to confirm where and how the Config object is injected into agent construction (ASPECT 5).\n\nI have identified the files and their roles and am ready to open and read those specific files to extract exact code locations and behavior.

EXPLORE the codebase step-by-step using the tools below\n2. READ relevant files to understand the logic\n3. ONLY after gathering enough evidence, provide your final answer\n4. DO NOT guess or provide answers before reading the actual code\n\n📌 ALLOWED TOOLS:\n- Navigation: cd, ls, find\n- Reading: cat, grep, head, tail, nl, sed\nYou are free to choose any of the tools above for efficient and precise exploration\n\n🎯 TARGET REPOSITORY: /root/RepoQA-Project/mini-swe-agent/src/minisweagent\n ▸ Start with: cd /root/RepoQA-Project/mini-swe-agent/src/minisweagent\n\n📋 INVESTIGATION STRATEGY:\n\n ASPECT 1: Parse the command-line argument that specifies the configuration YAML file (entry that receives argv and extracts the config path).\n Entry Point: unknown::main\n\n ASPECT 2: Resolve the provided config path (apply cwd, expanduser, environment variables, defaults) and open/read the YAML file bytes.\n Entry Point: unknown::resolve_config_path\n\n ASPECT 3: Load and parse the YAML content into a raw Python mapping (YAML loader step: yaml.safe_load or equivalent).\n Entry Point: unknown::load_yaml\n\n ASPECT 4: Convert the parsed mapping into the library's Config object(s) (apply schema, defaults, nested configs such as model configs).\n Entry Point: unknown::Config.from_dict\n\n ASPECT 5: Inject the resulting Config object into agent construction / runtime initialization (where the Config is passed to create the running agent).\n Entry Point: agents/default.py::DefaultAgent.__init__\n\n\n📍 SUBMISSION RULES (STRICT):\n 1. You MUST read and analyze the code using commands FIRST.\n 2. You CANNOT submit an answer in the same turn as your first exploration command.\n 3. A valid submission consists of:\n    - Turn N: Read/Explore the code.\n    - Turn N+1: Provide ## FINAL ANSWER based on Turn N's output.\n    - Turn N+1 Action: `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT`\n\n   in other word: Submit signal\n   In your NEXT turn after providing the answer, execute:\n   ```bash\n   echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT\n   ```\n   ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You can also include the ## FINAL ANSWER block again in this same message to ensure it is recorded.\n❌ DO NOT chain `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT` with other analysis commands.\n❌ DO NOT provide a detailed answer before you have received at least one observation from the files.\n\n📝 FORMAT: Thought + One ```bash block per turn.\n🚀 BEGIN YOUR JOB NOW\n\n💡 Note: [GRAPH HINT] will be provided when viewing code.\n\nYou can execute bash commands and edit files to implement the necessary changes.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n\nThis workflows should be done step-by-step so that you can iterate on your changes and any possible problems.\n\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n6. Submit your changes and finish your work by issuing the following command: `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT`.\n   Do not combine it with any other command. <important>After this command, you cannot continue working on this task.</important>\n\n## Important Rules\n\n1. Every response must contain exactly one action\n2. The action must be enclosed in triple backticks\n3. Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n   However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n<system_information>\nLinux 5.15.0-78-generic #85-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 7 15:25:09 UTC 2023 x86_64\n</system_information>\n\n## Formatting your response\n\nHere is an example of a correct response:\n\n<example_response>\nTHOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first.
